### perishky (Matthew Suderman)

* I am a [**Senior Lecturer in Epigenetic Epidemiology**](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/matthew-j-suderman) at the University of Bristol, UK.

* [**Epigenetics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics) is the study of mechanisms that determine biological charactistics independently of DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms have critical roles in development and response to the environment.

* [**Epidemiology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology) is the study of health and disease in populations.

* I create [**R packages and scripts**](https://www.r-project.org/) for analysing DNA methylation datasets generated using the [Illumina Infinium Beadchips](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/microarray.html), but have also created scripts for analysing data generated using other types of microarrays and high-througput sequencing.
    - [**The EWAS catalog**](https://github.com/MRCIEU/ewascatalog) is an online database of summary statistics of published epigenome-wide association studies. 
    - [**meffil**](https://github.com/perishky/meffil) is for the quality assessment, normalization and analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation datasets.
    - [**ewaff**](https://github.com/perishky/ewaff) is for testing associations in genome-wide DNA methylation datasets.
    - [**dmrff**](https://github.com/perishky/dmrff) is for identifying differentially methylated regions.
    - [**meffonym**](https://github.com/perishky/meffonym) is for calculating scores for a long list of DNA methylation models for estimating things like age and smoking history. 
    - [**alspac**](https://github.com/explodecomputer/alspac) is for querying the [ALSPAC](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/) study data which is stored in SPSS and STATA formats. 
    
* I regularly produce an [**update of the Epigenetic Epidemiology literature**](https://mrcieu.github.io/epigenetics-journal-club/) 1-2 times per month.

* I aim to write code that is as beautiful as [**perishky**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirozhki) is tasty.
