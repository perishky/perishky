### perishky (Matthew Suderman)

- I am a [Senior Lecturer in Epigenetic Epidemiology](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/matthew-j-suderman) at the University of Bristol, UK
- [**Epigenetics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics) is the study of mechanisms that determine biological charactistics independently of DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms have critical roles in development and response to the environment.
- [**Epidemiology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology) is the study of health and disease in populations.
- I create [R packages](https://www.r-project.org/) for analysing DNA methylation datasets generated using the [Illumina Infinium Beadchips](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/microarray.html), but have also created scripts for analysing data generated using other types of microarrays and high-througput sequencing.
- I maintain a regular update of the Epigenetic Epidemiology literature. 
- I aim to write code that is as beautiful as [perishky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirozhki) is tasty.
